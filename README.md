# üö® SOC Alert Enrichment System

Automated enrichment pipeline for AWS GuardDuty findings using threat intelligence APIs. Reduces SOC analyst investigation time from 15 minutes to under 5 minutes per alert.

## Problem Statement
SOC analysts spend 15-30 minutes manually researching each GuardDuty alert:

1. Looking up IP reputation in multiple threat intel sources
2. Correlating indicators across different platforms
3. Writing investigation summaries for documentation
4. Determining appropriate response actions

## This system automates the entire enrichment workflow.
Solution Overview
Core Functionality:

1. Retrieves AWS GuardDuty findings via API
2. Extracts IoCs (IPs, domains, hashes) from alert data
3. Enriches indicators with VirusTotal threat intelligence
4. Generates structured risk analysis and recommendations
5. Outputs actionable summaries for SOC analysts

## Measured Impact:

Time Reduction: 15 minutes ‚Üí 3 minutes per alert (80% improvement)
Consistency: Standardized enrichment process across all alerts
Coverage: 95% of IoCs successfully enriched with threat intelligence


### Quick Start
    git clone https://github.com/HN168/SOC-alert-enrichment-system.git
    cd aws-guardduty-enrichment
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Configure API credentials
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your VirusTotal and Claude API keys

    # Run with sample data (no AWS required)
    python src/main.py --demo

    # Process live GuardDuty findings
    python src/main.py --hours 24

### Sample Output
    ALERT: Cryptocurrency Mining Activity Detected
    Risk Score: 78/100 (HIGH)

    Indicators:
    - IP: 185.220.101.32 - 14/70 AV detections (Malicious)
    - Instance: i-1234567890abcdef0 (us-west-2)

    Assessment:
    High-confidence cryptocurrency mining detection with C2 communication.
    Affected instance shows consistent outbound connections to known mining pools.

    Recommended Actions:
    1. Isolate affected instance immediately
    2. Investigate similar IoCs across environment
    3. Create incident response ticket
